    "# Multi Query Strategy Evaluation\n",
    "The simple pipeline approach can be improved by using a Multi Query strategy. The goal of this strategy is to enhance the performance of the Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) model, particularly the context recall metrics. The key idea is to retrieve the documents that are most relevant for answering the user's query. The hypothesis is that the user's intended question may differ from the way they have written the query.\n",
    "\n",
    "To address this, the Multi Query strategy involves rewriting the user's query 5 times from different perspectives. This is done to uncover the relevant documents that can provide the necessary context. A chunk of text is then retrieved for each of these rewritten queries. Finally, the unique union of all these retrieved documents is used as the context for answering the original user query.\n",
    "\n",
    "The motivation behind this approach is to better capture the user's underlying informational need, even if it is not fully reflected in the initial query formulation. By diversifying the queries and aggregating the retrieved contexts, the system aims to improve the overall performance and relevance of the responses."
